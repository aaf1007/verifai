# THIS FILE DEFINES THE SHAPE OF ALL DATA
#
# Every class here is either:
#   - An Enum: a fixed set of allowed string values (e.g. verdict options)
#   - A Pydantic BaseModel: a typed data structure that validates and serializes JSON
#
# Pydantic BaseModel does two things automatically:
#   1. Validates incoming data — wrong type or missing required field → 422 error
#      before your endpoint code even runs.
#   2. Serializes outgoing data — converts the Python object to JSON when FastAPI
#      returns a response.
#
# Field() attaches extra rules to a field: min/max length, numeric bounds,
# a default value, and a description that shows up in the Swagger UI at /docs.
#
# Inheriting from both `str` and `Enum` means enum values serialize to plain strings
# in JSON ("TRUE", "FALSE", etc.) rather than an object like {"value": "TRUE"}.
