    This is the core of the fact-checking pipeline. Gemini is called with
    Google Search Grounding enabled, meaning it queries Google in real-time
    before composing its response. The verdict JSON comes from the model's
    text output; the source URLs come from the grounding metadata (actual
    Google Search results), not from the model's text — this is more reliable
    than asking the LLM to cite sources itself.

    If the model returns unparseable output, the function degrades gracefully
    to UNVERIFIABLE rather than raising an exception and crashing the request.

    Flow: called by verify_claims() for each ExtractedClaim → returns ClaimAnalysis

    Args:
        client: The shared Gemini SDK client injected from dependencies.py.
            Uses client.aio (the async interface) so the server can handle

            "The Eiffel Tower is 330 metres tall."

    Returns:

        source URLs from Google Search grounding, and topic domain.

        This function does not raise. JSON parse failures are caught internally
        and returned as a ClaimAnalysis with verdict=UNVERIFIABLE.
